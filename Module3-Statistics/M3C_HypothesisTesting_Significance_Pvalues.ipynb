    "\n",
    "**Non-parametric tests**, on the other hand, do not make assumptions about the distribution of the data or make fewer assumptions compared to parametric tests (see Wilcox signed rank test below). They are used when the data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests or when the data are ordinal or non-normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between parametric and non-parametric tests:\n",

    "**Assumptions**: Parametric tests make specific assumptions about the population distribution, such as normality and homogeneity of variances, while non-parametric tests make fewer or no assumptions about the distribution of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Test Statistics**: Parametric tests use test statistics that are based on the parameters of the population distribution (e.g., mean, standard deviation), while non-parametric tests use test statistics that are based on the ranks or order of the data.\n",

    "In summary, the choice between parametric and non-parametric tests depends on the nature of the data, the assumptions that can be made about the data, and the specific research question being addressed. If the assumptions of parametric tests are met, they are generally preferred because they can provide more powerful statistical tests. However, if the assumptions are violated, non-parametric tests may be more appropriate."

    "# Parametric Test Example -- Student's T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Student's t-test** is a **parametric statistical test** used to determine **is there is a significant difference between the means of two groups**. The t-test is commonly used in scientific research, especially in fields such as psychology, medicine, and biology, where it is used to compare means from experiments. For example, it often used to assess the effectiveness of interventions or treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was developed by **William Sealy Gosset**, who published it **under the pseudonym \"Student\" in 1908** while working at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland. \n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test is particularly useful when working with **small sample sizes** or **when the population standard deviation is unknown**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the t-test depends on whether the samples being compared are independent or dependent (paired). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent Samples t-test\n",
    "For independent samples, the t-statistic is computed by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}}{{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}}\n",

    "    & s_p \\text{ is the pooled standard deviation, given by:} \\\\\n",
    "    & s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}}{{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}}, \\\\\n",
    "    & \\text{where } s_1 \\text{ and } s_2 \\text{ are the standard deviations of the two groups}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the **Null Hypothesis** that the means of the two groups are equal, the t-statistic would follow a **t-distribution** with $n_1+n_2−2$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P-values\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis that the two distributions have the same mean, the t-statistic would be close to zero. The P-value using the t-test is found by calculating the probability that the a random sample drawn from from a t-distributon would be at least as large/small as the calculated t-statistic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that a larger $t$ would be sampled by chance is found by calculating **survival function** for the absolute value of $t$ (i.e., $\\text{surv}(|t|) = 1-CDF(|t|)$). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Two-Sided Test*: In a two-sided test, the null hypothesis typically states that there is no difference between the means of the two related groups, while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference, without specifying the direction of the difference. The two-sided test is used when you want to determine if there is a significant difference between the means in either direction. In this case, the critical region is split between the two tails of the distribution, and the p-value that at last as large a difference would be observed in the mean of the two populations is determined as $PV(t) = 2*\\text{surv}(|t|)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*One-Sided Test*: In a one-sided test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference or that group 2 is greater than or equal to group 1, while the alternative hypothesis specifies that group 1 is greater than group 2. The one-sided test is used when you are specifically interested in whether one group is greater than the other, but not if it's smaller. The critical region is located entirely in one tail of the distribution, and the p-value for testing if is determined as $PV(t) = \\text{surv}(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important limitations of the t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any test, the t-test has important limitations that one should consider before applying the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Assumption of Normality**: The t-test assumes that the data in each group are normally distributed. If this assumption is violated, the results of the test may be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Sensitive to Outliers**: The t-test can be sensitive to outliers, particularly when sample sizes are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Equal Variances Assumption**: The traditional independent samples t-test assumes that the variances of the two groups are equal. If this assumption is violated, alternative versions of the t-test, such as Welch's t-test, should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Sample Size**: The t-test may not perform well with very small sample sizes, as the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution only as sample size increases.\n",

    "1) Combine the data from the two groups into a single dataset.\n",
    "2) Rank all the observations in the combined dataset from smallest to largest, ignoring the group labels.\n",
    "3) Calculate the sum of ranks for each group.\n",
    "4) Use the smaller of the two sums of ranks as the test statistic (often denoted as U).\n",
    "5) Compare the test statistic to critical values from the Wilcoxon rank-sum distribution or calculate a p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: If the test statistic is significantly different from what would be expected by chance, it suggests that the distributions of the two groups differ significantly in terms of their medians.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is a non-parametric alternative to the independent samples t-test and is particularly useful when the assumptions of the t-test are not met. It does not assume normality or equal variances and is based on the ranks of the observations rather than their actual values.  However, like all tests, it has limitations:\n",
    "**Assumption of Independence**: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test assumes that the observations within each group are independent of each other and that the two groups are independent of each other. Violations of this assumption can lead to inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Data Requirement**: While the Wilcoxon rank-sum test does not require the data to be normally distributed, it does require that the data be at least ordinal. If the data are purely nominal (e.g., categories without a natural order), the test may not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensitivity to Ties**: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test can be sensitive to ties (i.e., identical values) in the data, especially if there are many ties or if the ties are not evenly distributed between the groups. This can affect the accuracy of the test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Less Power Than the t-test**: In general, parametric tests such as the independent samples t-test tend to have more statistical power (i.e., are better at detecting true differences) than non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, especially when the assumptions of the parametric tests are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty in Interpreting Effect Size**: While the Wilcoxon rank-sum test can determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the groups, it does not provide a direct measure of effect size. Interpreting the practical significance of the results can therefore be more challenging compared to parametric tests.\n",
